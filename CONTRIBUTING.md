Feel free to add all ideas to https://github.com/Kyle-P/Mathematics/blob/master/Ideas!

## Adding New Programs
 - When adding a new program, please check the ideas file and remove the idea once it's been tackled.
 - Be sure to add the programs under the correct subject folders.
 - Make sure your code is well-commented. This ensures that collaborators will be able to easily help with bugs or revisions.
 - MAKE SURE the program lets users know why the answer is the answer. It might be helpful to put yourself in the user's position and ask yourself if you would understand how the answer was computed based on what the program is outputting. This step is optional (for the user), so first prompt the user whether or not they would like an explanation, and if so, display the explanation.
 
## Fixing Issues
- Always include in pull requests which issue you are referring to with "[Action such as "closes"] #[issue number]."
